\section{Introduction}
During Christmas, my family bought a Christmas tree to place at home. Unfortunately, we lacked decorations, so we decided to go to the store to buy some garland for the tree. However, uncertain of how much we needed to buy, we took a guess at the amount we thought we needed. We tried to buy as little garland as we thought was necessary in order to minimize waste, but we ended up buying not enough garland. We then promptly returned to the store to buy more garland, but this time we ended up with way too much garland. When wrapping the garland around the tree, we also had a lot of trouble spacing successive rotations of the garland, and had to constantly undo and adjust our wrapping as we tried to make it look the way we wanted. Faced with these troubles, I decided that for my investigation, I would find a method to calculate the amount of garland required to wrap around my Christmas tree based on some chosen parameters, as well as find the optimal spacing for the garland in order to obtain a balance between meeting personal aesthetic preferences and minimizing waste.
