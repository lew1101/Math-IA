\section{Validation}

In order to verify that my equation is correct, I decided to test a set of 9 data points with different values for $\lambda$, $R$, and $H$. This was done by first inputting the values into the formula and evaluating using a calculator, and then comparing the result to the output generated by \emph{GeoGebra}'s \texttt{Length} function, which is capable of calculating the arc length of an inputted function given a starting $t$-value and ending $t$-value. The results are summarized in the table below.

    \caption{Comparison between the output of my formula and \emph{GeoGebra}.}
\end{table}

From the table, we can see that the output from my formula is accurate, as it matches the output generated by GeoGebra to 5 decimals points. While this does not prove that my general formula is accurate for all values of $\lambda$, $R$, and $H$, having 9 points where the outputs are exactly the same to 5 decimals is enough to convince me that my formula is exactly correct.
